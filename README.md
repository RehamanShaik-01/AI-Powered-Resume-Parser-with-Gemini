# AI-Powered-Resume-Parser-with-Gemini

Project Summary
This project is a smart, AI-driven Resume Parser that extracts essential candidate information from resumes in PDF or DOCX format using Google Gemini (Generative AI) and presents it in structured JSON format via an intuitive Streamlit web interface. It automates the manual process of screening and analyzing resumes, making it ideal for HR professionals and recruitment software tools.
Objectives
- To develop an intelligent system that reads resumes and extracts relevant information like name, email, phone number, skills, education, and work experience.
- To leverage a large language model (LLM) to understand varied resume formats and accurately parse them.
- To present the parsed data in a clean, structured JSON format for further automation or integration.
